# i3blocks-scripts
My self-made i3blocks scripts

## Scripts:

### gpu
Supports only Nvidia cards.  
Gets the utilization (load), temperature & vram usage from nvidia-settings to be used with i3blocks. Supports warn and crit colors.  

Call file with -f flag and provide format in a string. The script will replace the keywords in your format string with the corresponding values (see example below).  
Provide the lwarn and or lcrit flag with a number to change the color of the load and vram output.  
Provide the twarn and or tcrit flag with a number to change the color of the temperature output.  

Example: `./gpu -f "GPU: {load} TEMP: {temp} VRAM: {vram}"    ...will result in: "GPU: 34% TEMP: 39Â°C VRAM: 17%"`  
  
**Disclaimer:** Your i3block needs to include 'markup=pango' and the font you are using when calling the bar in your i3 config needs to be prefixed with 'pango:' for the colors to work!  
i3blocks.conf example:  
```
[gpu]
command=$SCRIPT_DIR/gpu -f "GPU: {load} TEMP: {temp} VRAM: {vram}"
markup=pango
interval=3
```  
  
config:  
```
bar {
    font pango:Futura Bk Bt Bold 11
    status_command i3blocks -c ~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf
}
```  
  
### updates

Click the block to see which packages can be updated (notification).
